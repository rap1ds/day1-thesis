Job satisfaction is one of the key elements in today's work life. From a company point-of-view an employee who enjoys the work is more effective that an employee who dislikes the work. Companies are also competing from the best employees and one key factor to draw good employee candidates is to have a working environment where employees enjoy to work.

Job satisfaction plays also a great role in how well the employee, especially the older employees cope in a work environment. In Finland, there is a pressure to raise the age of retirement and high job satisfaction has been identified to be one of the key elements.

In this paper I am going to research whether it would be reasonable for a Finnish IT-company Futurice to offer free soda for its employees. The research tries to answers whether offering free freshments would increase the job satisfactory level and performance.
